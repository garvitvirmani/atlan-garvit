# üíª Atlan SQL Editor

**Link to the application:** [Atlan SQL Editor](https://atlan-garvit.vercel.app/)

This is a web app that allows users to run SQL queries in an online editor and analyze the query results.

## Data Dump

The data used in the application is generated online from a website that provides mock data. The data is stored as a local JSON object, but CSV files can also be used with a different logic or a pre-existing format conversion library.

## Page Speed and Optimization

I've employed Google's Lighthouse tool and Page Speed Insights to assess the loading speed and adherence to web standards of the website. Furthermore, I've cross-verified the results using GTMetrix. When accessing the Homepage and the SQL Editor page on a laptop browser, the time it takes for both pages to become interactive is an impressive **0.5 seconds**.

### 1. Website Load Time

In this analysis, we are focusing on the page load time, which refers to the duration it takes for the website to become fully interactive. In all instances demonstrated below, the page load time comfortably meets Google's recommended standards for both mobile and desktop devices. This is an essential measure as it significantly impacts the user experience, ensuring swift and smooth navigation on the website.

For more comprehensive information, you can find detailed screenshots depicting the respective page load times in a later section of this document.

### 2. Optimizing the Page Load Time and other web vitals

1. The application has been turned into a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** to optimize it, as Google promotes the use of such installable apps. This also allows the web app to be used offline as it can be installed.

2. The website has been designed to be responsive, even though such an application is less likely to be used on mobile devices. Absolute sizing has been minimized, and sizing units like **em, rem, vh, and vw** have been utilized. Media queries have been employed in most cases, except for a few instances where Bootstrap was used for rapid development.

3. The website is hosted on Vercel, a fast and free hosting service for JavaScript-based web apps, offering the benefits of a CDN and caching. It also provides free SSL during hosting, enhancing page security and ranking.

4. React lazy loading has been implemented to load parts of the page that are not immediately required in the background.

5. Minimal dependencies have been used for the creation of the page.

6. The code has been restructured to reuse components and minimize imports where necessary.
